How To Prepare For Tech Interviews


Array




Linked List
Stack/Queue
Trees (Tree, Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc. Learn as many as you can)
Heap


Hash Table (this is really important - understand all of the different collision mitigation mechanisms, understand what amortized constant-time means)
Directed/Undirected/Weighted Graphs

Trie (pronounced "tree")
Linked Hash Map 





You should know the Big-O for insert, delete, lookup, etc. for each of these. Know how the mechanics work. It isn't a good interview questions, but you should be able to code every single one of these. Then, prepare real-world examples of when you'd want to use each of these and explain why it's the best choice. Data Structures come up in technical interviews in two way. The first is in coding questions where you're expected to use the right one at the right time. The second is on a comparison question - not connected to code - "why would you use X over Y in situation Z."
Sorting algorithms (both comparison sorting and non-comparison sorting)
Tree traversals (just memorize all of these inorder, preorder, postorder, level order)
Traversals - Dijkstra's, A*, BFS, DFS (know the difference between DFS and BFS when would you use one over the other and why - hint, is usually matters when you don't have to search the whole space. Also make sure that you can code recursively and using your own stack/queue)
All the prefix-tree searches
